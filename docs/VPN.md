# WireGuard VPN

## Server setup
To use the VPN feature you need a running [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) server to connect to.

The installation instructions are best covered on the official Wireguard website: https://www.wireguard.com/install/.

Next steps are covered in their quickstart guide: https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/.

There is a handy config generator website: https://www.wireguardconfig.com/. Just make sure to note the _Random seed_ so you can replicate the configuration if needed.

### Server config

An example entry of the _/etc/wg0.conf_:

```
[Interface]
Address = 10.100.0.1/24
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = Server+PrivateKey=
#PublicKey = Server+PublicKey=

[Peer]
PublicKey = Peer+PublicKey=
AllowedIPs = 10.100.0.2/32
```
